# TRAFFIC SOURCE ANALYSIS

## Introduction

Traffic source analysis is about understanding where your costumers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic. 
Paid traffic is commonly tagged with tracking (UTM) paraneters, which are appended to URLs and allow us to tie website activity to specific sources and campaigns.

In this repository I attach several exercises with MySQL that have been done from a real business database with the aim of assessing bid optimization. In the context of online advertising, a bid refers to the amount of money an advertiser is willing to pay for a specific ad placement or keyword in a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising model. When an advertiser wants their ad to be displayed on a search engine or other digital platforms, they participate in an auction-based system where they compete with other advertisers who are interested in the same ad space.
Analyzing for bid optimization is about understanding the value of various segments of paid traffic, so that you can optimize your marketing budget. 

The common uses for bid optimization are:

- Figure out how much should you be spending per click to acquire customers.
- Understand how your website and products perform for various subsegments of traffic to optimize within channels.
- Analyze the impact that bid changes has on your ranking and the volume of customers driven to your site.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
In the first exercises we are asked to get where the majority of the website sessions come from. We did a breakdown by UTM source, campaign and referring domain.
The result was that the utm_source "gsearch" and the utm_campaign "nonbrand" had the most number of sessions with difference.
